  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
  Participants are asked to bring their laptop with some specific 
  software packages installed (the Bash Shell, a text editor, Git, 
  and Python/Anaconda; set Setup instructions below). If you don't have a laptop, 
  that's completely fine. We'll pair you up with someone who does.
