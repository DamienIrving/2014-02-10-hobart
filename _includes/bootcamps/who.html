  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The Hobart bootcamp is aimed at postgraduate students (including honours) and other 
  research scientists working in the AMOS sciences (i.e. meteorology, climatoloogy,
  oceanography, glaciology) who are familiar with basic programming concepts like loops, 
  conditionals, arrays, and functions, but need help to translate this knowledge into 
  practical tools to help them work more productively.
