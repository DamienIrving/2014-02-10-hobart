  <strong>Registration:</strong>
    Participants can register at the <a href="www.amos2014.org.au/index.html">AMOS conference website</a>.
    Note that it is not anticipated that people who attended the AMOS/CoECSS bootcamp at the University 
    of Melbourne in February 2013 will also attend this one, as the teaching content will be very similar.
