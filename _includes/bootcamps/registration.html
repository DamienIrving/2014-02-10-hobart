  <strong>Registration:</strong>
    Participants can register at the <a href="www.amos2014.org.au/index.html">AMOS conference 
    website</a> ($120.00 for full fee and $90.00 for students). Registrations will close at the 
    same time as the standard registration period for the AMOS conference or 
    when the venue capacity (50 people) has been reached, whichever comes first. Note that it 
    is not anticipated that people who attended the AMOS/CoECSS bootcamp at the University of 
    Melbourne in February 2013 will also attend this one, as the teaching content will be very 
    similar.
