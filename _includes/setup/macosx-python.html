  <h4>Mac OS X / Anaconda</h4>

  <p>
    You may be able to simply follow the on-screen installation 
    prompts given by the package installer (as shown 
    <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html#mac-install">here</a>).
    If so, just note that you <em>do</em> want the package to automatically modify 
    your bash profile to add anaconda to your <code>PATH</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the package installer doesn't work or isn't available, you can
    install Anaconda from the command line as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Open a terminal window.
    </li>
    <li>
      Type <pre>bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda-</pre> and then press
      tab. The name of the file you just downloaded should
      appear.
    </li>
    <li>
      Press enter. You will follow the text-only
      prompts. When there is a colon at the bottom of the
      screen press the down arrow to move down through the
      text. Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to approve
      the license. Press enter to approve the default
      location for the files (or enter an alternative location). 
      Type <code>yes</code> and press enter to prepend Anaconda to
      your <code>PATH</code> (this makes the Anaconda
      distribution the default Python).
    </li>
  </ol>
